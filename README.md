# GO.Rest-Api-Albums

This project is a basic RESTful API developed in Go using the **Gin** framework. The API manages information about music albums, allowing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and partial updates.

## üöÄ Features

- **RESTful routes** for managing albums:
  - Get all albums (`GET /albums`).
  - Get an album by ID (`GET /albums/:id`).
  - Create a new album (`POST /albums`).
  - Fully update an album by ID (`PUT /albums/:id`).
  - Partially update an album by ID (`PATCH /albums/:id`).
  - Delete an album by ID (`DELETE /albums/:id`).
- **Structured JSON responses**.
- Error handling with clear messages.
- **Simple web server** rendering an HTML home page.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Go (version 1.23.3 or later).
- Project dependencies:
  - [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin).

### Example using `cURL`:

1. Retrieve all albums:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/albums
   ```

2. Create a new album:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/albums -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":"6","title":"New Album","artist":"Midnights","year":2022}'
   ```

3. Update an album:
   ```bash
   curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/albums/1 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":"1","title":"Born to Die - The Paradise Edition","artist":"Lana del Rey","year":2012}'
   ```

4. Delete an album:
   ```bash
   curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/albums/1
